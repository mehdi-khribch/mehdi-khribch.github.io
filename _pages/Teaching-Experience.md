With a passion for fostering intellectual growth and a commitment to excellence, I have had the privilege of serving as a teaching assistant in a diverse array of courses. 
My journey in education has encompassed key subjects such as Monte Carlo methods and stochastic processes. 

Through these experiences, I have strived to cultivate a dynamic and engaging learning environment, equipping students with the analytical tools and insights necessary to thrive in these complex domains.
