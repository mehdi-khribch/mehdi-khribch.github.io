Masterâ€™s Dissertation, Oxford, UK.

Developed a new Algorithm from the class of Metropolis-Hasting Sampling Algorithms targeting
a class of thin tailed distributions and derived non-asymptotic upper bounds on mixing times
achieving state of the art results extending previous results obtained for MALA.
