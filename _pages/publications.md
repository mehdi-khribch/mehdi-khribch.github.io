### On PAC Bayesian bounds: Faster rates in hostile grounds

<address>
Master’s Dissertation, Paris, France.
</address>

Extended a PAC Bayes inequalities and mutual information bounds to a class of heavy-tailed
losses getting state-of-the-art fast rates.

### [On Mixing Times of Metropolized Algorithm With Optimization Step (MAO): A New Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00565/)

<address>
Master’s Dissertation, Oxford, UK.
</address>

Developed a new Algorithm from the class of Metropolis-Hasting Sampling Algorithms targeting
a class of thin tailed distributions and derived non-asymptotic upper bounds on mixing times
achieving state of the art results extending previous results obtained for MALA.
