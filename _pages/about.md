<p>I am a final-year PhD candidate in the <a href="https://isds-department.essec.edu/home/">IDS Department</a> at ESSEC Business School, supervised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pierrejacob/">Pierre E. Jacob</a> and <a href="https://pierrealquier.github.io/">Pierre Alquier</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to my PhD, I received an Engineering Degree from <a href="https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/">Mines Paris PSL University</a>, the <a href="https://www.master-mva.com/">Master MVA (Mathématiques, Vision, Apprentissage)</a> from <a href="https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/">ENS Paris-Saclay</a>, and an MSc in Statistical Science from the <a href="https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>.</p>

<p>My research focuses on computational statistics and robust Bayesian inference. I am particularly interested in:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Unbiased MCMC methods</strong> using coupling techniques for Monte Carlo estimation</li>
  <li><strong>PAC-Bayesian theory</strong> with applications to robust statistical inference and variational approximations</li>
  <li><strong>Importance sampling</strong> and the convergence analysis of Monte Carlo algorithms</li>
</ul>

<p>My goal is to develop scalable and theoretically grounded algorithms that bridge classical robust estimation with modern machine learning.</p>
