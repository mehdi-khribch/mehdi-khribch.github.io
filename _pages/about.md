I am currently a second year  PhD student in the [IDS Department](https://isds-department.essec.edu/home/) Department of Statistics at ESSEC Business School, working with [Pierre E. Jacob](https://sites.google.com/site/pierrejacob/).

Prior to that, I received an Engineering Degree from [Mines Paris PSL University](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/). Prior to that, I obtained the Master MVA [(Math√©matiques, Vision, Apprentissage)](https://www.master-mva.com/) MSc at [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/). 
I also hold an MSc in Statistical Science from [Department of Statistics, University of Oxford](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of Bayesian nonparametric statistics and machine learning, with a keen focus on Monte Carlo methods. 
I am particularly interested in the intricate dynamics of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and their potential for unbiased estimation using coupling techniques.
I am also interested in PAC-Bayes theory and, more generally, in developing scalable, robust algorithms for computational statistics and machine learning.
