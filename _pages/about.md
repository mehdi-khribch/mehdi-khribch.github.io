<p>I am a final-year PhD candidate in the <a href="https://isds-department.essec.edu/home/">IDS Department</a> at ESSEC Business School, working with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pierrejacob/">Pierre E. Jacob</a> and <a href="https://pierrealquier.github.io/">Pierre Alquier</a>. Prior to that, I received an Engineering Degree from <a href="https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/">Mines Paris PSL University</a>. Before that, I obtained the <a href="https://www.master-mva.com/">Master MVA (Mathématiques, Vision, Apprentissage)</a> at <a href="https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/">ENS Paris-Saclay</a>, and I also hold an MSc in Statistical Science from the <a href="https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Statistics, University of Oxford</a>.</p>

<p>My research interests lie in computational statistics and Bayesian inference. I focus on unbiased MCMC methods using coupling techniques, PAC-Bayesian theory for robust statistical inference, and variational approximations. My goal is to develop scalable, theoretically grounded algorithms for computational statistics and machine learning.</p>
