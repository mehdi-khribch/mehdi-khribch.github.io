I am a third-year PhD student in the [IDS Department](https://isds-department.essec.edu/home/) at ESSEC Business School, working with [Pierre E. Jacob](https://sites.google.com/site/pierrejacob/) and [Pierre Alquier](https://pierrealquier.github.io/). Prior to that, I received an Engineering Degree from [Mines Paris PSL University](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/). Before that, I obtained the Master MVA [(Mathématiques, Vision, Apprentissage)](https://www.master-mva.com/) MSc at [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/), and I also hold an MSc in Statistical Science from the [Department of Statistics, University of Oxford](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/).

My research interests are in Bayesian statistics more broadly, and in particular Bayesian nonparametric statistics and its intersection with statistical machine learning. I have a keen focus on Monte Carlo methods—especially the dynamics of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and unbiased estimation via coupling techniques—as well as variational approximations and PAC-Bayes theory, all aimed at developing scalable, robust algorithms for computational statistics and machine learning.
